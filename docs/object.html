<h1>Billie Jean</h1>
<p>
<br>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene.</br> <br>I said don't mind but what do you mean, I am the one.</br><br> Who will dance on the floor in the round?</br> <br>She said I am the one, who will dane on the floor in the round.</br>
<br>She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.</br> <br> Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one.</br> <br> Who will dance on the floor in the round.</br>
<hr> <strong><b>That was just a couple lines from Billie Jean by Michael Jackson</strongn></b></hr>
