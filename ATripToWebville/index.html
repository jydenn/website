<h1>Questions</h1>
<h2>What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a hosting company? What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?</h2>
<p>The solution that we used to solve our problem was by using students.gctaa.net account to do our commits.</p>
<h2>A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register their own domain name. See if you can find these classmates and ask them how they did it. What is the process involved? Where can you go to register a domain name?</h2>
<p>One person that I saw with a custom domain name was Jack Ploetz.  Another person that I saw with a custom domain name was Patrick.  There are a number of websites that you can use to make custom domain names.  I think that the most popular one would be godaddy.</p>
<h2>Compare the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this point) with the one we use. How are they different? How are they similar?</h2>
<p>I think that the workflow in the book is a bit faster than the workflow that we are doing right now.  I think that using the book would of made it eaiser because I think that it would of been easy to follow along with the starbuzz and roadtrip assignments in the book.  But both workflow work fine and are able to give the correct informaiton in a good amount of time.</p>
