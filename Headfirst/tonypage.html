<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Conseqences, NM.</p>
<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
<p>I was some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A Glimpse, Of eternity.  I definitely wont be passing any cars.</p>
<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't albe to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protien bar.  Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
